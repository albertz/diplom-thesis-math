\section{Conclusion and further work}

We have developed an generic algorithm to calculate the vector space of Fourier expansions of Hermitian modular forms.

Unfortunately, we haven't gotten any results which seems to be because of mistakes in the implementations (as it was also noted in \cref{chapter:impl}). It seems likely that these are only minor issues. Further work should fix these bugs.
