# Step 1. Iterate through square-free numbers l, starting at 1.

# Init curlS = {}.

# Step 3. Iterate S \in Mat_2^T(Z). Add to curlS. iterate by denominator.

# Step 3a. Choose B>0 as limit for precision curlF.
# TODO: how? dependent on S?

# Step 4. Calculate restriction matrix.

# Step 5. dimension check
# TODO
#   This comes last. It's written in Dern.

# If check fails, goto step 3 and enlarge curlS.
