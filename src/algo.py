# Step 1. Iterate through square-free numbers l, starting at 1.

# Init curlS = {}.

# Step 3. Iterate S \in Mat_2^T(Z). Add to curlS. iterate by denominator.
# S_11 and S_22 (diagonal entries) are positive.
# S positive definite?
# S can be changed arbitrarily by GL(2, \ZZ).

# Step 3a. Choose B>0 as limit for precision curlF.
# TODO: how? dependent on S?

# Step 4. Calculate restriction matrix.

# Step 5. dimension check
# TODO
#   This comes last. It's written in Dern.

# If check fails, goto step 3 and enlarge curlS.

# Otherwise, reconstruct fourier expansion.
