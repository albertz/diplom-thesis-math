\section{Introduction}

We develop an algorithm to compute Fourier expansions of Hermitian Modular Forms of degree 2 over $\Sp_2(\curlO)$ for $\curlO \subseteq \Q(\sqrt{-\Delta})$, $\Delta \in \Set{3,4,8}$.

In \cite{PoorYuen07Comp}, spaces of Siegel Modular Cusp forms are calculated.

A similar algorithm is also \cite[Algorithm 4.3]{Raum12Jacobi} for Jacobi forms.

We are doing the same for Hermitian Modular forms.
