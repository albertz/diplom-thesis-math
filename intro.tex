\section{Introduction}

We develop an algorithm to compute Fourier expansions of Hermitian modular forms of degree 2 over $\Sp_2(\curlO)$ for $\curlO \subseteq \Q(\sqrt{-\Delta})$, $\Delta \in \Set{3,4,8}$.

In \cite{PoorYuen07Comp}, spaces of Siegel modular cusp forms are calculated. It uses a linear reduction of Siegel modular forms to Elliptic modular forms and gains information from there. This is very similar to what we are doing with Hermitian modular forms.

A similar algorithm is also \cite[Algorithm 4.3]{Raum12Jacobi} for Jacobi forms.

We are doing the same for Hermitian modular forms.

Along with the theoretical work, the algorithm has also been implemented. The implementation has been done with the Sage (\cite{sage}) framework. It is implemented in C++ (\cite{cpp}), Cython (\cite{cython}) and Python (\cite{python}). The code can be found on GitHub (\cite{Zeyer13Github}) and another backup might be on \cite{Zeyer13Homepage}.
