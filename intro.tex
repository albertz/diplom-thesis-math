\section{Introduction}

We develop an algorithm to compute Fourier expansions of Hermitian Modular Forms of degree 2 over $\Sp_2(\curlO)$ for $\curlO \subseteq \Q(\sqrt{D})$, $D \in \Set{-3,-4,-8}$.

In \cite{PoorYuen07Comp}, spaces of Siegel Modular Cusp forms are calculated.

We are doing the same for Hermitian Modular forms.
